We propose an additional research questions that can be answered with the dataset used in the paper:

1)Title

2)Abstract
A 150 word description of the project idea, goals, datasets used. What's the motivation behind your project? How do you propose to extend the analysis from the paper? What story would you like to tell, and why? 

1)Research Questions
2)A list of research questions you would like to address during the project.
Proposed dataset
List the dataset(s) you want to use, and some ideas on how you expect to get, manage, process, and enrich it/them. Show us that you've read the docs and some examples, and that you have a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant. It is your responsibility to check that what you propose is feasible given the datasets at hand.

3)Methods

4)Proposed timeline

5)Organization within the team
A list of internal milestones up until project milestone P4. Add here a sketch of your planning for the next project milestone.

6)Questions for TAs (optional)
Add here any questions you have for us related to the proposed project.



 1. Title:
 Impact of wealth on eating habits
 
 2. Abstract:
 (attention 150 mots c'est quand meme bcp ^^)
 
 3. Research questions:
 Are there significant correlations between food habits and wealth ? 
 
 More precisely we will try to answer some of the following hypothesis:
  - Are there correlations between lower revenue ward populations and the amount of soft drinks, sweets and ready-made food products.
  - Is the amount of certain nutricients (like saturated fats, free sugars, fibers) significatively different in certain ward populations.
(  - Is food entropy a relevant factor of wealth ? )
  
 
 These questions might help us to bring an element of answer to the question "Do wealthier ward areas buy food that could be judged healthier ?"
